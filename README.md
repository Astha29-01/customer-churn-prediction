# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn for a telecom company.

## 📂 Dataset
- [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- 7043 customers with features like tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and churn status

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression (performed best)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- SMOTE applied for class imbalance

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy: 77%
- Precision (churn): 0.56
- Recall (churn): 0.69
- F1-score (churn): 0.62

## 📊 Key Insights
- Contract type, tenure, and tech support are major churn indicators
- Longer-tenured customers are less likely to leave
